Whenever we open the CoWin Website it says the slot are fully booked.So, i have made Telegram bot using Python and the API which are provided by the government and its legal to make your own script using that. Earlier it was way much more easy to book the slot using those scripts, but now at the end of booking they have added the Captcha feature.

The basic thing it will do is that it will notify you where the Slots are Available. So that you can book your slots.
